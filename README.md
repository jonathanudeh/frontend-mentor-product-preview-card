## My-process

### Built-with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What-I-learned
Nothing new, Though I just practiced more with css grid.

### Continued-development
I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiarized with them both even though my flexbox skills are a lot smoother than that of my grid.
